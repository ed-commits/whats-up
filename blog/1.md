So far there is no code or design or anything written. The idea for this is to create a simple social media site for practice and for my portfolio.
I'll use Django because I think that will allow me to get it done much faster than implementing all the parts from scratch.
The first milestone will just be a landing page which lets you either create an account or log in.

Later on I would like to add the following features:

* edit and update your profile.
* add friends to your friends list.
* post status updates.
* view a feed of all your friends status updates.
* a plugin or modular system to enable extra types of statuses to be posted, for example having watched a movie, played a game, or to upload a picture, create a poll etc.

The site on its own would be rather basic but it could be used in many settings, for example if someone created a chess game site they could connect it with this to add social media features on the site between players.
